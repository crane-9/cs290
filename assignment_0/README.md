Five websites with five aspects each that I like or dislike about them.


### 1. Moodle

I use Moodle for all of my current classes; it's been a while since I've had to use something that wasn't Moodle.

#### Likes: 

1. **It functions.** It works. It provides accurate information. When your session is close to expiring, the appropriate popup appears, and when your session *has* expired, that popup updates to tell you you've been logged out.

2. **Predictability.** When I'm looking for certain information, Moodle's design is fairly consistent with where to find the given information (ie, seeking an instructor or fellow student's mail.linnbenton.edu address). Navigation within a course works as expected with the hierarchal sections 

#### Dislikes: 

1. **Notifications.** When I've taken classes with weekly forums, I tend to get spammed with emails alerting every post. This critique is half-baked as I'm not currently in a class where I could configure forum notifications, and I haven't spent a lot of time attempting to configure Moodle notifications in the past. However, I remember struggling with preferences, and I'm a little frustrated by getting email notifications before I get on-site notifications.

2. **Home page.** The home page doesn't really serve any purpose to me. It doesn't hold information relevant to me. It's a small complaint, but this doesn't make sense to me.

3. **Usability for instructors.** (This dislike may be unfair.) I hear a lot of instructors complain about Moodle. From what I have seen, I have wondered how easy it is to use from the instructor's side.
