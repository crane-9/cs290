# Final Reflection

## notes

- generally got overwhelmed a lot during these because of time management and/or just trying to do too much? but at the same time i kinda doubted certain aspects would meet requirements, as i kinda just had fun until i had something that looked like my initial concept.
- uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i didn't learn how to do accesibility like i intended to. i kinda just made some classes that acknowledged it and then left that for later me. bummer.
- generally scope creep but also i wish i took more time to sit and think about what i wanna do thoroughly. but it's ok bc this is for a class. or is it.

### assignment 1

- auogaog

### assignment 4

- straight up forgot to implement the draft feature

### assignment 5

- discovered the popover does not work on safari. or iphones in general, i already forgot -- the point is i did not thoroughly check stuff enough before throwing it out there. bummer.

### final

- probably could have just used my first assignment and given it a backend.
- HOWEVER. i learned the most in this one with using pug and express. this is awesome and i am probably going to rebuilt svelte projects in this framework as this makes more sense to me and i feel i have more control.
    - think what about the downsides: what can sveltekit do that i can't easily and conveniently do.
    - _ _
    - uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyeah nothing
    - Heh.
- i really do spend most of my time building the visuals, but man it's fun ok. it's fun.
